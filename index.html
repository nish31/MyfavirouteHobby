        Minecraft is a game in which reality and fantasy meet . So, basically you get to indirectly learn and have fun at the same time . For example I never knew about Lapis Lazuli until I played minecraft another example would be learning that if you heat sand enough you get glass !. That is the reason why I LOVE Minecraft . It is so fun that I bet even when i grow up I will still play it. My dream is to become a youtuber of Minecraft and maybe one day meet Dream (The youtuber).
